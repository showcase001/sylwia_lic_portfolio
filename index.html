			<h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
			<p>Hello! Nice to meet you! I hope we can get to know each other. I'll start, if you don't mind, since you seem interested. 
			<br> <br>	
			I have varied interests, and look forward to applying what I learn to new experiences, as well as gathering even more knowledge to apply. I like nature and interesting media. I like to read both fiction and nonfiction, particularly anything related to finance. I am trying to get into the field of SEO, and am learning about that, and working on getting certifications. I am also learning how to make websites from scratch using HTML and CSS - this is my first public website!
			<br> <br>
			If you see anything in common or interesting you want to discuss with me, please let me know! I am open to making new connections. Just click the 'Contact Me' link at the bottom of the page.</p>
